**MIG Memory Forensic library**

⚠️ Deprecation Notice ⚠️
-------------------------

Mozilla is no longer maintaining the Mozilla InvestiGator (MIG) project.

Mozilla is also no longer making use of this code internally.

You are welcome to use this code as is with no warranty. Please fork it to continue development.

**MASCHE** stands for **Memory Analysis Suite for Checking the Harmony of Endpoints**. It is being developed as a project for the *Mozilla Winter of Security program*.

It works on **Linux**, **Mac OS** and **Windows**.

These are the current features:

 * listlibs: Searches for processes that have loaded a certain library.
 * pgrep: Has the same functionallity as pgrep on linux.
 * memaccess/memsearch: Allows access and search into a given process memory.

You can find examples under the examples folder.

## Compiling

You need `golang` installed.

### Linux
You need glibc for 64 and 32 bits installed. On Fedora, the packages are:
* glibc-devel.i686
* glibc-devel.x86_64
* glibc-headers.i686
* glibc-headers.x86_64
* glibc.i686
* glibc.x86_64
 
### Windows

In order to compile and run masche in windows you will need a gcc compiler. You can use mingw if you are running a 32 bits version of Windows or mingw-64 if you are running a 64 bits one.
Just run `go build` on the package/example that you want.

It's possible to cross-compile from linux. And this is the recommended way.
* Install a cross compiler (for example, `mingw-w64`)
* Enable cross compiling in your go toolchain (run `GOOS=windows ./all.bash` inside your `$GOROOT/src` folder)

After that you should be able to cross compile masche without problems, just make sure to export the correct global variables: `GOOS=windows` `CGO_ENABLED=1` `CC=<your-cross-compiler>` (for example: `CC=x86_64-w64-ming32-gcc` )
